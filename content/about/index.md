### Purpose
The purpose of the Welsh Technical Standards Board (WTSB) is to support the creation and maintenance of a catalogue of standards and requirements to enable integration and interoperability across all health and care systems in a consistent and secure manner, and to support local innovation and the use of third party delivery partners.

The scope of this Board covers:

* Interoperability Standards
* Integration standards
* Software development standards
* Infrastructure standards
* Cyber security standards


### Responsibilities:

The WTSB is responsible for the following (in line with its agreed scope):

* the identification, assessment and setting of principles and standards and for assuring the application of agreed principles and standards across the NHS Wales architecture. This will take in to account integration between health and social care and also the need to share information with health and care organisations outside of the UK.
* The ongoing maintenance of the catalogue of standards, including:

  -  establishing a road map to support the implementation of agreed standards, including how each standard should be implemented and used
  - periodically assessing agreed standards to ensure they remain relevant and appropriate
  - establishing a road map to support the decommissioning of standards
  - identifying opportunities locally, regionally and nationally to adopt standards providing quick wins/early benefits, case studies and learning to inform the road map. 
  - embedding an interoperability framework within NHS procurement at a local and national level to ensure that procurements are appropriately scored as to their level of interoperability.

### Governance

The WTSB reports to the NHS Wales Informatics Management Board (NIMB).

The WTSB may decide to establish temporary working groups to take forward specific packages of work. These groups may be jointly established by WTSB and the Wales Information Standards Board (WISB).
