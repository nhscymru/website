Our mission is to :

> support the creation and maintenance of a catalogue of standards and requirements to enable integration and interoperability across all health and care systems in a consistent and secure manner, and to support local innovation and the use of third party delivery partners.
> 
> from [WTSB Terms of Reference](/about/)

And we are working hard to build that catalogue. 

But is that all we need to do? 

We debated this during our [March meeting](/meetings/2019-03-28), and it became clear that we will *not* have succeeded in our work if we simply published a list of standards on a webpage or bookshelf. 

Instead, we must ensure that standards are practical and focused on *solving real problems*. 

We must recognise that technical standards are an important enabler for the outcomes outlined in [“A Healthier Wales”](https://gweddill.gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/180608healthier-wales-mainen.pdf) and the [“Informed Health and Care”](https://gweddill.gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/151211reporten.pdf) strategies and are required in a digital age to:

* Ensure that information is available when and where it is required
* Facilitate quicker and more soundly based decision making
* Reduce waste, cutting out repeated work
* Improve safety with fewer errors

As a result, rather than adopting an authoritarian approach to standards, I see our core function as building collaborative partnerships in which we work closely with stakeholders across health and care in Wales, and beyond. We are not an authority; we work in collaboration.

We witnessed this in our discussions; in this case, inviting domain expertise in pharmaceutical medicine in order to gain insights. We, as a board, bring a set of core principles and an approach predicated upon the use of standards as a *force-for-good*, our  colleagues bring their problems and domain expertise and we work together and we *learn*. 

In this way, our influence goes far beyond building a catalogue of standards, but instead, our work can be used to engender culture change, and inculcate a respect for the appropriate use of technical standards across health and care in Wales.

My conclusion? Standards, when done right, can drive positive culture change.
